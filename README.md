Spring Security application using Spring Boot

# Step 0 - In memory authentication 
In this branch, I used a simple in-memory authentication, users are hard coded in SecurityConfiguration.java. 

You can log in through: 
• username=user and password=user => This user has role USER 
• username=admin and password= admin => This user has role ADMIN
